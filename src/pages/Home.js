                  <p>
                    SisterHoop was born from a personal experience that
                    highlighted a significant gap in the basketball community.
                    One day, as I was heading to my local basketball court for a
                    pickup game, I couldn't help but notice that the court was
                    dominated by boys. As a female basketball enthusiast, I
                    often felt shy about joining them because of the intense
                    competition for spots in the game.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This repeated experience sparked an idea: creating an app
                    specifically designed to connect female basketball players.
                    SisterHoop aims to provide a safe and encouraging
                    environment where female athletes can play, improve, and
                    enjoy the game without feeling overshadowed or sidelined.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The development of SisterHoop is a significant part of my
                    journey at Holberton School, serving as a Portfolio Project
                    that showcases the skills and knowledge I've gained. You can
