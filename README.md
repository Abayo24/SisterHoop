# SisterHoop

![banner](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/565b0852-1616-43dd-b26a-096a4d6db5cd)

SisterHoop is a platform designed to connect female basketball players, providing a safe and encouraging environment where they can find local courts, join pickup games, and interact with other female athletes. The project was born out of my personal experience as a female basketball enthusiast who often felt sidelined in a predominantly male environment. SisterHoop is built to ensure that women can enjoy basketball without feeling overshadowed or excluded.

## üìñ Technical Details
### Backend:

Node.js & Express: Chosen for its non-blocking I/O and real-time capabilities, ideal for the dynamic nature of our app.
MySQL: Selected for its ACID compliance and strong consistency, suitable for structured data like user profiles and game schedules.
Frontend:

React: Used for building a dynamic and interactive user interface.
Leaflet: Integrated with OpenStreetMap to provide interactive and customizable map features.
Technical Challenge:
Early on, I faced challenges with integrating Google Maps API due to billing issues. This led to switching to OpenStreetMap, which required adapting our application to handle asynchronous data and dynamic markers. Despite the hurdles, the switch allowed for a more flexible and cost-effective solution.

## üí¨ Personal Story
SisterHoop emerged from my own experience as a female basketball player often overshadowed in a male-dominated environment. Each visit to the court where I was either alone or with just one other female sparked the idea to create a platform where women could feel more included and supported. Building SisterHoop as a solo developer was a journey through frontend and backend development, database management, and more. It solidified my passion for creating user-friendly applications and inspired me to tackle future projects with confidence.
